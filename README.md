# COVID-19 ResearchPaper Finder APP
This app is for helping researchers providing them efficient access to research papers related to COVID-19. The papers have been classified into medical and non-medical using machine learning algorithms. We have collected and gathered data from different sources, the major one being WHO's openly accessible database. We do not store any of the papers, instead we re-direct you to those research papers.
